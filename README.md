# 317's Obsidian Plugins
> There won't be 317 plugins, because it's a lot of plugins


Obsidian is cool. Very cool. but sometimes it lack things. So I will do plugins that do the things. 

The plugins are made on top of the [volcano](https://github.com/kognise/volcano) plugin loader brought to us by the good [Kognise](https://github.com/kognise)



## Installation

### Node.js & Volcano
Just follow the Volcano's [README.md](https://github.com/kognise/volcano/blob/232eaffb6883e6117c7475062dcd891d6a0e14b6/README.md) instructions.


### The plugins
Just copy/paste the plugins in the Volcano directory.

**Windows path:**
```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\volcano\plugins
```

**Unix path:**

```
