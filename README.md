# 317's Obsidian Plugins
> There won't be 317 plugins, because it's a lot of plugins


Obsidian is cool. Very cool. but sometimes it lack things. So I will do plugins that do the things. 

The plugins are made on top of the [volcano](https://github.com/kognise/volcano) plugin loader brought to us by the good [Kognise](https://github.com/kognise)
